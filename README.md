# Yelp-Contest-Romance-in-Restaurants
In this project I use the yelp data provided by the Yelp company at : https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge
I will use natural language processing methods to infer some features from restaurants that corresponds 
with romantic needs of different groups. I will analyse these features through different machine learning processes. 

Romance is an understudied aspect of cities and the built environment. Yet, restaurants continue to attract couples and augment the landscape with these visible signs of affection at a table for two—or more. The user-generated content (UGC) of restaurant reviews from Yelp provide text on romantic keywords such as “date”, “love”, “boyfriend”, “wife”, “anniversary”, “family”. We use these to distinguish restaurants, and then find the features of restaurants that are associated with each romantic keyword. These features include restaurant ratings and location, as well as comments about the ambiance, food, service, etc.

Using data from the Yelp Data Set Challenge in U.S. cities Pittsburgh, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Charlotte, we employ different data mining and correlation tools as well as GIS modeling to learn more about relationships in the city. For example, we find that families prefer restaurants that are outside of the central business district (CBD) while couples—married or dating—prefer hot spots of nightlife. We also find that inexpensive food is not associated with romantic dates, and the quality of service also plays a secondary role to a “classy” and “cozy” atmosphere.
