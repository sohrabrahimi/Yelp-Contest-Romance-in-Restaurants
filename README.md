# Yelp-Contest-Romance-in-Restaurants
In this project I use the yelp data provided by the Yelp company at : https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge
I will use natural language processing methods to infer some features from restaurants that corresponds 
with romantic needs of different groups. I will analyse these features through different machine learning processes.
